3757_But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?_Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?_3.0
3758_Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin._Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness._3.0

10797_I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master._Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master._8.0
10798_Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother._For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to._8.0
10799_Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says._He had a kind of taste.—Well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, budge not.” “Budge!” says the fiend._8.0
10800_Don’t go,” says my conscience._Budge not,” says my conscience._8.0

10802_But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself._And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself._8.0
10803_The devil’s advice is nicer._The fiend gives the more friendly counsel._8.0
10804_I’ll run, devil._I will run, fiend._8.0

10815_He’s just Launcelot._Your worship’s friend and Launcelot, sir._8.0
10816_Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that?_Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?_8.0
10817_It’s obvious._But tell not me._8.0
10818_No, that’s not it, trust me._Believe me, no._8.0
10819_So it’s not my business that’s making me sad._Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad._8.0
